## Project Overview

**Goal:** Deploy scalable and maintainable ML models with full lifecycle management.  

**Scope:**  
- Automate model training and evaluation  
- Enable CI/CD for ML pipelines  
- Deploy models on production-ready infrastructure  
- Implement monitoring for performance drift  

**Current Status:**  
- Experimenting with **:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}** for model training  
- Tracking experiments using MLflow  
- Building CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions

## Experiment Tracking

**Experiment Example:**  
- Model: Random Forest for customer churn prediction  
- Dataset: `customer_data_v2.csv`  
- Metrics:
  - Accuracy: 0.87  
  - Precision: 0.83  
  - Recall: 0.79  

**Notes:**  
- Hyperparameter tuning improved recall by 5%  
- Next step: Test with **:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}** automatic model tuning

## Pipeline Development

**Pipeline Steps:**  
1. Data preprocessing  
2. Feature engineering  
3. Model training & evaluation  
4. Model versioning and storage (S3 / DVC)  
5. Deployment to staging  
6. Monitoring & alerts  

**Current Implementation:**  
- Initial pipeline running locally  
- Next step: Integrate with **Kubeflow** for orchestration  

---

## Model Deployment

- Environment: Docker container on Kubernetes cluster  
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions triggering SageMaker training & deployment  
- Status: Deployed staging endpoint for testing  
- Next: Automate rollback on model performance degradation  

---

## Monitoring & Maintenance

**Monitoring Metrics:**  
- Model accuracy over time  
- Data drift detection  
- Latency and throughput  

**Tools Used:**  
- Prometheus & Grafana dashboards  
- CloudWatch logs for SageMaker endpoints  

**Next Steps:**  
- Implement automated alerts for performance degradation  
- Integrate model retraining triggers  

---

## Notes & Learnings

- Automating ML pipelines saves hours in repetitive tasks  
- **Experiment tracking** is crucial for reproducibility  
- Containerization ensures consistent deployments  
- Cloud platforms like **:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}** accelerate large-scale training
